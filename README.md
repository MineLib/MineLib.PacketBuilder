# MineLib.PacketBuilder 

Takes data from http://wiki.vg/Protocol and builds Packet classes from table data stuff.

Kinda works actually. Of course, based on .Core projects, so yea, needs modification to use for others. Not sure, but shoudn't be too hard to do it.

Those Modern packets are not supported: 0x20, 0x22, 0x26, 0x34, 0x37, 0x38, 0x44, 0x45.
I'll add support later. Maybe.
